passworDDD 3D Security - unique gobbledygook-free passwords for every website

Generate unique gobbledygook-free passwords for every website to protect yourself against hackers - if one site is cracked, you won't have to worry about changing your password on other websites. The approach is easy enough to be understood by a 11 year old (who helped develop it), while using cutting edge cryptography techniques (A Salted Hash with Diceware). Here is a summary of the 3 dimensions of security:

1) Type a website name - this will be used to inform a Hash function which will scramble the website name into a unique password
2) Pick 4 of your favorite things in the tool - Your selections will be used as part of the Salt to help create the unique password for each website
3) Let the tool generate the password - using the concept of Diceware the tool will convert some of the random numbers generated from the Salt and Hash into English words from a list of 10,000 options. Use the same 4 favorite things for any other website and the password will always be different because of the power of mathematics and cryptography - Amazeballs! For even extra security, append a secret word to what the tool generates
