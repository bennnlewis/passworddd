passworDDD 3D Security - unique gobbledygook-free passwords for every website

Generate unique passwords for every website to protect yourself against hackers - if one site is cracked, you won't have to worry about changing your password on other websites. The approach is easy enough to be understood by a non-professional, while using modern cryptography (A Salted Hash with Diceware).  The 3 dimensions of security:

1) Type a website name - this will be used to inform a Hash function which will scramble the website name into a unique password
2) Pick 4 of your favorite things - Your selections will be used as part of the Salt to help create the unique password for each  website
3) Let the tool generate the password - using the concept of Diceware the tool will convert your choices into one of 10,000 words.  Use the same 4 favorite things for any other website and the password will always be different because: math!
